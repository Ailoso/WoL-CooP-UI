UserData/Achievements/TRaynor01 Objectives_Description=Complete all mission objectives in the "Liberation Day" mission.
UserData/Achievements/TRaynor01 Objectives_Name=Liberation Day
UserData/ArmoryData/Advanced Construction_Effects=- Multiple SCVs can build a structure.<n/>- Each additional SCV reduces build time.<n/>- Building cost remains the same.
UserData/ArmoryData/Advanced Construction_Flavor Text=This revolutionary computer allows multiple SCVs to work on the<n/>same structure simultaneously. The onboard assistant is so<n/>efficient at coordinating that building costs are<n/>unaffected.<n/><n/>This upgrade is vital when trying to get a base up and running<n/>quickly, or when trying to rebuild a broken defense.
UserData/ArmoryData/Advanced Medic Training_Effects=- Medics no longer require the Tech Lab add-on.
UserData/ArmoryData/Advanced Medic Training_Flavor Text=Storing Medpacks has traditionally required the advanced facilities of the Tech Lab. Remedius Medical Systems now offers a storage facility that can be housed in the barracks itself, eliminating the need for the Tech Lab when training and outfitting Medics.
UserData/ArmoryData/Building - Fire-Suppression Systems_Effects=- All structures repair themselves to 50% life.<n/>- All structures fires are automatically put out.
UserData/ArmoryData/Building - Fire-Suppression Systems_Flavor Text=This all in-one safety system automatically dispatches robotic<n/>drones to put out any fires and perform basic repairs on<n/>damaged structures.<n/><n/>Although these drones are effective at doing basic repairs, they<n/>do not have strong enough AI to perform the more delicate<n/>repairs needed to restore a structure past half life.
UserData/ArmoryData/Building - Orbital Command_Effects=- Grants the Scanner Sweep and Calldown: MULE abilities.<n/>- Scanner Sweep: Reveals an area in the fog of war.<n/>- Calldown: MULE: Calls down a temporary robotic miner.
UserData/ArmoryData/Building - Orbital Command_Flavor Text=ATVX now manufactures a satellite comlink that can reveal<n/>unexplored areas on the map.<n/><n/>This comlink can also call down a MULE. A MULE gathers much<n/>more faster than an SCV and can produce a major surge in mineral<n/>production. Because it is a prototype, the MULE will come apart<n/>after a short period of time, but it is still well worth the cost.
UserData/ArmoryData/Bunker - Neosteel Bunker_Effects=- Bunkers gain 2 additional slots.
UserData/ArmoryData/Bunker - Neosteel Bunker_Flavor Text=This bunker uses a high-density Neosteel frame, leaving more room inside for additional infantry without increasing the overall Bunker footprint.<n/><n/>While ordinary bunkers can hold a maximum of four infantry, Neosteel Bunker can hold up to six infantry in fortified comfort,
UserData/ArmoryData/Bunker - Projectile Accelerator_Effects=- Bunkered units gain +1 range.
UserData/ArmoryData/Bunker - Projectile Accelerator_Flavor Text=Wolfe Industries has developed a Bunker port that houses a<n/>magnetic rail. This device dramatically accelerates all projectiles<n/>coming out of the port, increasing the range of all weapons fired<n/>from the Bunker.
UserData/ArmoryData/Combat Shield_Effects=- Marines gain +10 life.
UserData/ArmoryData/Combat Shield_Flavor Text=M98 combat shields are a vital upgrade for any Marine fighting on the front line. 30mm of bonded carbide may not sound like much, but field tests have shown a full 25% increase in Marine survivability when equipped with Combat Shields.
UserData/ArmoryData/Concussive Shells_Effects=- Marauder attack slows all units in target area.
UserData/ArmoryData/Concussive Shells_Flavor Text=Concussive Shells actually form a gravitational warp when they<n/>detonate. This warp not only damages the target but it also<n/>slows the movement speed of all nearby units to crawl for a<n/>short period of time.<n/><n/>Concussive Shells make Marauders a great support unit against<n/>melee units, in addition to their traditional role of destroying<n/>armored targets.
UserData/ArmoryData/Dual-Fusion Cutters_Effects=- SCVs repair twice as fast.
UserData/ArmoryData/Dual-Fusion Cutters_Flavor Text=<n/>The SCV's ability to get damaged mechanical units back to full life,<n/>and even repair units while they are taking damage, has been a<n/>key advantage over Protoss and Zerg.<n/><n/>The Dual-Fusion Welder allows SCVs to repair at twice the<n/>speed, improving their ability to keep damaged units alive in the<n/>heat of the battle.
UserData/ArmoryData/Fire-Suppression Systems_Effects=- All structures repair themselves to 50% life.<n/>- All structures fires are automatically put out.
UserData/ArmoryData/Fire-Suppression Systems_Flavor Text=This all in-one safety system automatically dispatches robotic<n/>drones to put out any fires and perform basic repairs on<n/>damaged structures.<n/><n/>Although these drones are effective at doing basic repairs, they<n/>do not have strong enough AI to perform the more delicate<n/>repairs needed to restore a structure past half life.
UserData/ArmoryData/Firebat - Incinerator Gauntlets_Effects=- Firebats gain a 40% larger area attack.
UserData/ArmoryData/Firebat - Incinerator Gauntlets_Flavor Text=This upgraded Gauntlet channels the flamer's fuel through multiple ports rather than the single port of the previous generation. This results in a much wider flame without any loss of intensity, allowing your Firebats to hold enemies at bay with a literal wall of fire.
UserData/ArmoryData/Firebat - Juggernaut Plating_Effects=- Firebats gain +2 armor.
UserData/ArmoryData/Firebat - Juggernaut Plating_Flavor Text=Juggernaut Plating strengthens the Firebat's natural weak spots<n/> and thickens the helmet and chest pieces. This upgrade allows<n/> Firebats to shrug off the attacks of other infantry units and soak<n/> up incredible amounts of damage from small-arms fire.
UserData/ArmoryData/G-4 Clusterbomb_Effects=- Anti-personnel charge with a large blast radius.<n/>- Ejects smaller payloads in a radius for increased damage.
UserData/ArmoryData/G-4 Clusterbomb_Flavor Text=This anti-personnel charge detonates shortly after being thrown.<n/>The initial blast ejects a cluster of smaller charges that deal<n/>additional damage in a large radius.<n/><n/>Please note that Enlightened Dynamics assumes no liability for<n/>deaths due to friendly fire.
UserData/ArmoryData/Hellion - Twin-Linked Flamethrower_Effects=-Doubles width of the Hellion's flame attack.
UserData/ArmoryData/Hellion - Twin-Linked Flamethrower_Flavor Text=ATVX has developed a Twin-Linked version of the Hellion's Flamethrower. The model produces a flame that is twice as wide as the original.<n/><n/>Hellions can now literally douse groups of enemies in overlapping flames with this upgrade
UserData/ArmoryData/Hellstorm Batteries_Effects=- Missile Turrets gain a second attack.<n/>- Second attack does area damage.
UserData/ArmoryData/Hellstorm Batteries_Flavor Text=Hellstorm Batteries are an additional weapon set that can be<n/>fitted to your Missile Turrets. Each battery fires several small<n/>missiles that accompany the standard missile attack and<n/>saturate the target area on impact.<n/><n/>Hellstorm Batteries are a great way to welcome swarms of<n/>enemy flyers to your base. Don't disappoint!
UserData/ArmoryData/Incinerator Gauntlets_Effects=- Firebats gain a 40% larger area attack.
UserData/ArmoryData/Incinerator Gauntlets_Flavor Text=This upgraded Gauntlet channels the flamer's fuel through multiple ports rather than the single port of the previous generation. This results in a much wider flame without any loss of intensity, allowing your Firebats to hold enemies at bay with a literal wall of fire.
UserData/ArmoryData/Juggernaut Plating_Effects=- Firebats gain +2 armor.
UserData/ArmoryData/Juggernaut Plating_Flavor Text=Juggernaut Plating strengthens the Firebat's natural weak spots<n/> and thickens the helmet and chest pieces. This upgrade allows<n/> Firebats to shrug off the attacks of other infantry units and soak<n/> up incredible amounts of damage from small-arms fire.
UserData/ArmoryData/Kinetic Foam_Effects=- Marauders gain +25 life.
UserData/ArmoryData/Kinetic Foam_Flavor Text=Marauder armor can survive crushing impacts, but the same cannot always be said for the soldier inside. To help solve this problem, Wolfe Industries offers a Kinetic Foam undersuit that protects the soldier from the violent impacts the armor takes.<n/><n/>Surely the lives of your marauders are worth the small investment required to outfit them with Kinetic Foam.
UserData/ArmoryData/Marauder - Concussive Shells_Effects=- Marauder attack slows all units in target area.
UserData/ArmoryData/Marauder - Concussive Shells_Flavor Text=Concussive Shells actually form a gravitational warp when they<n/>detonate. This warp not only damages the target but it also<n/>slows the movement speed of all nearby units to crawl for a<n/>short period of time.<n/><n/>Concussive Shells make Marauders a great support unit against<n/>melee units, in addition to their traditional role of destroying<n/>armored targets.

UserData/ArmoryData/Marine - Combat Shield_Effects=- Marines gain +10 life.
UserData/ArmoryData/Marine - Combat Shield_Flavor Text=M98 combat shields are a vital upgrade for any Marine fighting on the front line. 30mm of bonded carbide may not sound like much, but field tests have shown a full 25% increase in Marine survivability when equipped with Combat Shields.
UserData/ArmoryData/Marine - Stimpacks_Effects=- Grants the Stimpack ability.<n/>- Effect: Marine takes 10 damage, fires and moves 50% faster.<n/>- Duration: 15 seconds.
UserData/ArmoryData/Marine - Stimpacks_Flavor Text=Stimpacks provide a temporary boost to the Marine's attack and movement speeds by dosing him with a mix of adrenaline, endorphins, and aggression enhancers.<n/><n/>This frenzied burst does come at the expense of the Marine's health. Medical treatment is highly advisable after many uses.
UserData/ArmoryData/Medic - Advanced Medic Training_Effects=- Medics no longer require the Tech Lab add-on.
UserData/ArmoryData/Medic - Advanced Medic Training_Flavor Text=Storing Medpacks has traditionally required the advanced facilities of the Tech Lab. Remedius Medical Systems now offers a storage facility that can be housed in the barracks itself, eliminating the need for the Tech Lab when training and outfitting Medics.
UserData/ArmoryData/Medic - Stabilizer Medpacks_Effects=- Medics heal targets 25% faster.<n/>- Medics use 33% less energy per heal.
UserData/ArmoryData/Medic - Stabilizer Medpacks_Flavor Text=The Stabilizer Medpack is a new generation of medical Nanobot that heals targets more efficently and can be injected at faster rates. Show your Marines that you truly care by outfitting your Medics with Stabilizer Medpacks today!
UserData/ArmoryData/Missile Turret - Hellstorm Batteries_Effects=- Missile Turrets gain a second attack.<n/>- Second attack does area damage.
UserData/ArmoryData/Missile Turret - Hellstorm Batteries_Flavor Text=Hellstorm Batteries are an additional weapon set that can be<n/>fitted to your Missile Turrets. Each battery fires several small<n/>missiles that accompany the standard missile attack and<n/>saturate the target area on impact.<n/><n/>Hellstorm Batteries are a great way to welcome swarms of<n/>enemy flyers to your base. Don't disappoint!
UserData/ArmoryData/Missile Turret - Titanium Housing_Effects=- Missile Turrets gain +75 life.
UserData/ArmoryData/Missile Turret - Titanium Housing_Flavor Text=<n/>Enlightened Dynamics has developed a new Titanium Housing for<n/>the Missile Turret. Early adopters have found this housing to be<n/>noticeably tougher than the original, allowing Missile Turrets to<n/>absorb more punishment before failing
UserData/ArmoryData/Neosteel Bunker_Effects=- Bunkers gain 2 additional slots.
UserData/ArmoryData/Neosteel Bunker_Flavor Text=This bunker uses a high-density Neosteel frame, leaving more room inside for additional infantry without increasing the overall Bunker footprint.<n/><n/>While ordinary bunkers can hold a maximum of four infantry, Neosteel Bunker can hold up to six infantry in fortified comfort,

UserData/ArmoryData/Reaper - G-4 Clusterbomb_Flavor Text=This anti-personnel charge detonates shortly after being thrown.<n/>The initial blast ejects a cluster of smaller charges that deal<n/>additional damage in a large radius.<n/><n/>Please note that Enlightened Dynamics assumes no liability for<n/>deaths due to friendly fire.
UserData/ArmoryData/Reaper - U-238 Rounds_Effects=- Reapers gain +1 range.<n/>- Reapers do an additional +3 damage to light armor.
UserData/ArmoryData/Reaper - U-238 Rounds_Flavor Text=U-238 Rounds are made from depleted uranium. These rounds<n/>are extremely dense (1.67 times the density of lead), so they<n/>have increased range and hit lightly armored units much harder.
UserData/ArmoryData/SCV - Advanced Construction_Effects=- Multiple SCVs can build a structure.<n/>- Each additional SCV reduces build time.<n/>- Building cost remains the same.
