UserData/UpgradeData/[Base-Bunker] Neosteel Frame_Effects=- Increases bunker capacity by 2.
UserData/UpgradeData/[Base-Bunker] Neosteel Frame_Flavor Text=This bunker uses a high-density neosteel frame, leaving more room inside for additional infantry without increasing the overall bunker footprint.

This upgrade is vital when trying to get a base up and running quickly, or when trying to rebuild a broken defense.
UserData/UpgradeData/[Base-SCV] Dual Fusion Welders_Effects=- SCVs repair twice as fast.
UserData/UpgradeData/[Base-SCV] Dual Fusion Welders_Flavor Text=The SCV's ability to get damaged mechanical units back to full life, and even to repair units while they are taking damage, has been a key advantage over the protoss and the zerg. The Dual-Fusion Welder allows SCVs to repair at twice the speed, improving their ability to keep damaged units alive in the heat of battle.
UserData/UpgradeData/[Base-Turret] Hellstorm Batteries_Effects=- Missile turrets gain Hellstorm Battery secondary attack. <n/>- Hellstorm batteries fire 8 missiles that each deals 1 point of splash damage.
UserData/UpgradeData/[Base-Turret] Hellstorm Batteries_Flavor Text=Hellstorm Bateries are an additional weapon set that can be fitted to your missile turrets. Each battery fires several small missiles that accompany the standard missile attack and saturate the target area on impact. Hellstorm Batteries are a great way to welcome swarms of enemy flyers to your base. Don't disappoint!
UserData/UpgradeData/[Base-Turret] Titanium Housing_Effects=- Missile turrets gain +75 hit points.
UserData/UpgradeData/[Base-Turret] Titanium Housing_Flavor Text=Enlightened Dynamics has developed a new titanium housing for the missile turret. Early adopters have found this housing to be noticeably tougher than the original, allowing missile turrets to absorb more punishment before falling.
UserData/UpgradeData/[Base] Projectile Accelerator_Effects=- Bunker units gain +1 range.
UserData/UpgradeData/[Base] Projectile Accelerator_Flavor Text=Wolfe Industries has developed a bunker port that houses a magnetic rail. This device dramatically accelerates all projectiles coming out of the port, increasing the range of all weapons fired from the bunker

UserData/UpgradeData/[Infantry-Marine] Combat Shield_Effects=- Increases the hit points of marines by 10.
UserData/UpgradeData/[Infantry-Marine] Combat Shield_Flavor Text=M98 Combat Shields are a vital upgrade for any marine fighting on the front line, 30mm of bonded carbide may not sound like much, but field tests have shown a full 25% increase in marine suitability when equipped with Combat shields.
UserData/UpgradeData/[Infantry-Marine] StimPack_Effects=- Enables affected infantry to attack and move 50% more quickly.
UserData/UpgradeData/[Infantry-Marine] StimPack_Flavor Text=Stimpacks provide a temporary boost to the marine's attack and movement speeds by dosing him with a mix of adrenaline, endorphins, and aggression enhancers.<n/><n/>This frenzied burst does come at the expense of the marine's health. Medical treatment is highly advisable after multiple uses.
